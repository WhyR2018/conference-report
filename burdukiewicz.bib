@misc{biecek_dalex:_2018,
	abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) models are widely used and have various applications in classification or regression. Models created with boosting, bagging, stacking or similar techniques are often used due to their high performance, but such black-box models usually lack of interpretability. DALEX package contains various explainers that help to understand the link between input variables and model output. The single\_variable() explainer extracts conditional response of a model as a function of a single selected variable. It is a wrapper over packages 'pdp' and 'ALEPlot'. The single\_prediction() explainer attributes parts of a model prediction to particular variables used in the model. It is a wrapper over 'breakDown' package. The variable\_dropout() explainer calculates variable importance scores based on variable shuffling. All these explainers can be plotted with generic plot() function and compared across different models.},

In many applications, it is infeasible to manually maintain an accurate and complete record of all these details about a particular analysis.
